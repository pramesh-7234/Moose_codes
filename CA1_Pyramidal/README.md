A model of a CA1 Pyramidal Neuron to understand the properties of A type K+ channels as described Dax Hofmann and Daniel Johnston 
in their 1997 paper K+ channel regulation of signal propagation in dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons.

The original .asc file was downloaded from NeuroMorpho.org and converted to .swc file via [xyz2swc](https://neuromorpho.org/xyz2swc/ui/) 
and the morphology was reduced by shape_shifter.py (a morphology reducing python script).
[ShapeShifter repo](https://github.com/neurord/ShapeShifter).

The passive parameters and the channel dynamics parameters were taken from the paper itself.
